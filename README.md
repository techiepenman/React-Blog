# Overview

I used React to re-build my humble two page blog that I had originally created to practise use of flex-box and grid in responsive layout.  
It might like an overkill for such tiny project and I totally get that. The main reason for me to go on the React path was re-usibility of the UI components where it empowers the blog to use the components any time anywhere.  
It's always good to leave some room for expansion for a weblog.
